# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows you to make and save changes to your code while tracking these changes. When working on a team with many other developers, this can be helpful in collaborating on different portions of a project and reviewing each others code before merging it into the final master.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Branches are essentially the forks within your own repository Branches will have an ancestor commit in your repository, and will diverge from that commit with your changes. You can later merge your branch changes. Branches let you work on multiple features at once

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is when you have created an updated version of the code and you would like to save/or upload your new code. A commit message lets the other people reading the code know what you did and why you changed the code. It serves as an explanation that can save a lot of time. should have the following:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line (leave second line blank)
2.Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end subject line with a period
5.Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how



* What is a merge conflict?

Merge is the act of integrating another branch into your current working branch. Someone can submit code that conflicts with the code that you submitted and it creates and error so you must review the code and choose how to move forward.
