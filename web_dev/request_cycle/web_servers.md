1. What are some key design philosophies of the Linux Op System?

Linux, much like Unix is built with the philosophy assuming that the user of their op system would be computer literate and know their way around the command line. There was no preventing them from doing stupid things- because those same boundaries would prevent them from doing clever and creative things as well.

Linux gives complete control and will execute a command without asking if you really want to perform this command.

2. What is VPS (virtual private server) and list advantages?

a VPS is a machine sold by an interest hosting service that can run it's own copy of an operating system and customers can have extreme access to the op system, so they have the ability to install any software that runs on it. Advantages are you can customize everything.

3. Why is it a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

You are more prone to make mistakes or software bugs. You can damange files in your home directory and a few other devices like USB disks. Everything in the system may accidentally be deleted easily- you are all powerful using root.
